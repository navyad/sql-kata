Atomic: 
	-- all or nothing, either commit or abort.
	-- refers to indivisible and irreducible operations.
	-- e.g: transfer money from account A to B.

Consistency: 
	-- A transaction is valid for defined rules, constraints etc.
	-- On completion of a transaction database is left in valid state.

Isolation: 
	-- concurrent transaction must be isolated from each other.
	-- if two users are performing some operation on an entity
	   then changes of one should not be clobbered with other, for 
	   that to happen each transactions are run sequentially.
	-- Concurrency control provides isolation.

Durability:
	-- Once a transaction is commited, changes are durable and never lost in case of power loss, crashes etc.
